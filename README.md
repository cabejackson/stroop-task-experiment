# Stroop Task Experiment

This project uses jsPsych to run a Stroop Task Experiment.

## What is the Stroop Task?

The Stroop Task is an experiment developed to explore automatic processing in the brain. It asks participants to identify the color of words. For example, the text might read Blue, but the font color might be red. Most people struggle with this task.

## Why does the brain struggle with this task?

The brain is wrestling between different cognitive processes: reading the word and identifying the color of the word. This is called cognitive interference, when one cognitive process slows down another.

### Sometimes the brain doesn't struggle with this task:

Some examples in the task display a word that's the same as its color. When information processing complements each other that's called facilitation and usually leads to faster responses.

## What areas of the brain are activated when doing this task?

- Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) --> decision making/goals
- Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) --> error detection
- Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) --> rewards! (dopamine spikes!!)
